            I am <del>Mark Nino</del><s> R. Quijano</s> <ins>Mark Nino Quijano</ins>, a <abbr title="Computer Engineering">CompE</abbr> student with a passion for technology and innovation. From a young age, I was always fascinated by computers and how they worked. This curiosity led me to choose computer engineering because I was motivated when I played pc games with my siblings and wanted know when you save the game, make it fun to play, and how it works.

            When I'm not in my studies, you can often find me playing a game of chess or playing of mobile games. Chess has been a long-standing hobby of mine, teaching me valuable lessons in strategy, critical thinking, and patience. It is a game that constantly challenges me to improve and adapt my skills. Additionally, mobile gaming provides a fun and interactive escape, allowing me to unwind and connect with friends. My favorite quote is <q><i>Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.</i></q> attributed to Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese military strategist and philosopher.

            The story behind my name is an interesting one. "Mark" was given to me by my uncle from America, who wanted to honor our family's heritage and create a connection between our two countries. As for "Nino," it was a nickname that stuck because I was small when I was a baby. It's funny how such a small detail can become a part of your identity. With each passing day, I strive to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of computer engineering, while also finding joy in the simple pleasures of life.
